It is like being in a huge house with many rooms- there are so many places to sit including tables for laptops and couches. This place is very laptop friendly as there are many tables with many electrical outlets to plug into. For those who want to enjoy the outdoors, there is a nice patio with shade to protect against the weather. The coffee and teas are delicious and so are the cheesecake and burritos! Try the dirty chai if you can.  They stay open late which is nice since most coffee shops in Denver close by 7 or 8 pm at the latest. I highly recommend this cozy coffee house for families, students, travelers, and business people.'}]})
